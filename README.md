As the CSV file is shown the weekly budget consumed and the engineer estimated the same story as the complexity point, the burndown chart is shown relation between Accumulated Budget Consumed and the Complexity Points Remaining.

I used Python to get the end point data which is estimate complexity of the story. Code:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanlee3721/Applico-Data-Analyst-Intern-Assignment/master/pivotaltracker_api.py

Then I used Excel to create the burndown chart.
